# Redash-ChatBot-Add-On
The aim of this project is to build a novel Redash chat add-on that our team members can use to extract insight from multiple Redash dashboards and from connected databases using natural language. User queries could be about what is already displayed in the dashboard or questions that require generating SQL query using LLMs to be run against our connected databases.
